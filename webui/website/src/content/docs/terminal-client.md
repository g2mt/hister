## Global Flags

These flags are available on every command:

| Flag                       | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config PATH`            | Path to config file (default: `./config.yml`, `~/.histerrc`, or `~/.config/hister/config.yml`)  |
| `--server-url URL` / `-u`  | Hister server URL (overrides `server.base_url` from config)                                     |
| `--token TOKEN` / `-t`     | Access token for server authentication (overrides `app.access_token` from config)               |
| `--log-level LEVEL` / `-l` | Log level: `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, `trace` (default: `info`)                       |
| `--search-url URL` / `-s`  | Default search engine URL with `{query}` placeholder                                            |
| `--client-timeout N`       | HTTP client timeout in seconds for server communication (0 = no timeout; default if unset: 10s) |

Example: index a slow extractor, such as `yt-dlp`, with a longer timeout:

```bash
hister --client-timeout 20 index https://example.com
```

## Command-Line Usage

View all available commands:

```bash
./hister help
```

### Index a URL Manually

To manually index a specific URL:

```bash
./hister index https://example.com
```

For persistent recursive crawls, URL list jobs, custom job names, resume behavior, request
backends, and every `crawl` subcommand, see [Website Crawler](crawler).

### Exporting Documents

Use `hister export` to write indexed documents to a JSON file. This is useful for
backups or for moving documents between Hister instances. By default every indexed
document is exported:

```bash
hister export backup.json
```

You can limit the export to documents matching a search query by passing it after the
output file (see the [query language](query-language) reference):

```bash
hister export rust.json "rust language:en"
```

Each document is written as a single JSON line; lines that do not start with `{` are
structural markers (`[`, `]`, `,`) and can be safely skipped by parsers. Pass `-` as the
output file to write to standard output instead, which can be piped into other tools:

```bash
hister export - | gzip > backup.json.gz
```

Use `--start-date` / `--end-date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to only export documents whose `updated`
timestamp falls within the given date range. The resulting file can be re-imported with
`hister import file` (see below).

### Importing Documents

Use `hister import file` to add documents from files on disk. It accepts an arbitrary
number of files or directories, which are imported in order and reported as a
combined total:

```bash
hister import file export.json page.html ~/Downloads/saved-pages
```

Three input formats are supported, detected by file extension:

- **JSON export files** files previously created by `hister export`. They are read
  line by line and each serialized document is restored without running content extraction
  again.
- **7z archives** (`.7z`) a 7z-compressed archive containing a single JSON export file.
- **HTML files** (`.html` or `.htm`) a saved web page. The document URL is extracted
  from the HTML itself (the `<link rel="canonical">` tag, OpenGraph/Twitter `url` meta
  tags, etc.) and the page is submitted to the running server for processing. The import
  fails for a given file if the HTML cannot be parsed or no URL can be found in it.

When a directory is passed, Hister imports matching `.json`, `.7z`, `.html`, and `.htm`
files directly inside that directory in filename order. Other files and nested
directories are ignored.

```bash
# Import a single saved web page
hister import file ~/Downloads/article.html

# Import all supported files directly inside a directory
hister import file ~/Downloads/saved-pages
```

Useful flags:

- `--skip-existing` do not overwrite documents that are already in the index.
- `--start-date` / `--end-date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) only import documents whose `added`
  timestamp falls within the given date range (applies to JSON exports).
- `--batch-size` controls how many documents are submitted in each bulk request.
  The default is `10` and the maximum is `100`.

> **Note:** `hister import file` talks to a running Hister server, so make sure the server
> is started before importing. See [Importing Documents](import) for file,
> browser history, and Linkwarden import instructions.

## TUI (Terminal UI)

Hister provides a terminal-based user interface for searching your browsing history without leaving your terminal.

### Start the TUI

Run the search command without any arguments:

```bash
hister search
```

### TUI Features

- **Multi-tab interface**: Search, History, Rules, and Add tabs
- **Mouse support**: Scroll with mouse wheel, click to select, right-click for context menu
- **Theming**: Built-in color themes with interactive picker (press `ctrl+t`)
- **Settings overlay**: Edit keybindings interactively (press `ctrl+s`)
- **Context menu**: Right-click on results for quick actions (open, delete, prioritize)

### Tabs

- **Search** (Alt+1): Main search interface
- **History** (Alt+2): View your recent search history
- **Rules** (Alt+3): Manage skip, priority, versioning, and alias rules
- **Add** (Alt+4): Manually add URLs to the index

### TUI Keybindings

The TUI uses the following keybindings by default:

| Key          | Action          | Description                                    |

- **Scroll wheel**: Navigate through results
- **Scrollbar drag**: Quick scroll through long result lists

### Customizing TUI

TUI settings are stored in a separate `tui.yaml` file alongside your main config file. This file is automatically created with default values when you first run `hister search`.

On a typical Linux setup the path is `~/.config/hister/tui.yaml`. On other platforms, or when a custom config path is selected, `tui.yaml` is stored beside the main config file.

#### tui.yaml Structure

```yaml
# Theme settings
dark_theme: 'tokyonight'
light_theme: 'catppuccin-latte'
color_scheme: 'auto'
# themes_dir: "/path/to/custom/themes"  # optional

# TUI keybindings
hotkeys:
  ctrl+c: 'quit'
  ctrl+t: 'toggle_theme'
  ctrl+s: 'toggle_settings'
  ctrl+o: 'toggle_sort'
  alt+1: 'tab_search'
  alt+2: 'tab_history'
  alt+3: 'tab_rules'
  alt+4: 'tab_add'
  # ... and all other TUI keybindings
```

#### Available TUI Actions

- `quit` - Exit the TUI application
- `toggle_help` - Show/hide the help overlay
- `toggle_focus` - Switch between input and results views
- `scroll_up`/`scroll_down` - Move selection up/down
- `open_result` - Open selected URL in browser
- `delete_result` - Delete selected entry from index
- `toggle_theme` - Open theme picker
- `toggle_settings` - Open keybinding editor
- `toggle_sort` - Toggle sorting mode
- `tab_search`/`tab_history`/`tab_rules`/`tab_add` - Switch tabs

Note: After modifying `tui.yaml`, restart the `hister search` command to apply changes.
